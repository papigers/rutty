RuTTY (aka Ruthie) is a CLI-powered websocket server written in Rust that allows you to expose your commands via browser.
RuTTY was written with the sole-purpose of me wanting to expermient with Rust.

## How it works?

RuTTY was **heavily** inspired by a very similar tool written in Go, called [GoTTY](https://github.com/yudai/gotty).

RuTTY run a command for each client connection, forwards the TTY stdout to the client, and forwards the client input to the TTY stdin. RuTTY uses [xterm.js](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js) to show a TTY display on the webpage.

## Installtion

`cargo install rutty`

## Usage

To run rutty simply run `rutty` and add your command and any optional arguments to that command, e.g. `rutty vi test.txt`.

| --title (-t)      | HTML page title                          | `RuTTY Server`                     |
| --reconnect (-r)  | Automatic reconnection delay             | `None` (no automatic reconnection) |

## Development

Clone the repository, install `rust`, `node` & `yarn`.

### Build

Debug build: `make build`.\
Release build: `make build release=1`

### Run

`cargo run -- <COMMAND> <ARGS>`

### Web development

An automatic hot-reload of the static files can be done by running `yarn start` inside the `web` directory, which will use `parcel` to start a development server on http://localhost:1234 that is proxied to your RuTTY server running on port 3000.
